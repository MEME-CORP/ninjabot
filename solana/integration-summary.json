  "notes": "Phase 1 testing successfully validated our Solana wallet management system on mainnet. We identified and overcame challenges related to Solana's rent exemption mechanism. The updated scripts properly handle transaction confirmations using different commitment levels ('confirmed' for transactions and 'finalized' for final confirmation) and implement proper retry logic with exponential backoff to handle rate limiting on the public RPC endpoint."
