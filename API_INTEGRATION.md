# Solana API Integration

This document outlines the implementation of the integration between the Telegram Bot and the Solana API according to the phase-based approach specified in the integration plan.

## Implementation Overview

The integration follows a systematic phase-based approach, implementing and validating each slice before proceeding to the next. The following slices have been implemented:

### Phase 0.1 — Wire base URL & health-check
- Updated `API_BASE_URL` in `bot/config.py` to point to the Solana API at `https://solanaapivolume.onrender.com`
- Disabled the mock flag in `ApiClient` to use real API calls
- Added `check_api_health()` method to verify connectivity with the API by calling the `/api/jupiter/tokens` endpoint

### Phase 0.2 — Wallet lifecycle
- Implemented `create_wallet()` to create a mother wallet via `/api/wallets/mother`
- Implemented `import_wallet()` to import an existing wallet using a private key via `/api/wallets/mother` with the `privateKeyBase58` parameter
- Implemented `derive_child_wallets()` to derive child wallets via `/api/wallets/children`

### Phase 0.3 — Balance polling
- Implemented `check_balance()` to fetch wallet balance via `/api/wallets/mother/:pk`
- Added filtering by token address when a specific token is requested

### Phase 0.4 — Schedule generation server-side
- Enhanced `generate_schedule()` to attempt to use an API endpoint for schedule generation
- Added fallback to local schedule generation if the API endpoint doesn't exist

### Phase 0.5 — Funding helpers
- Implemented `fund_child_wallets()` to fund child wallets from a mother wallet via `/api/wallets/fund-children`

### Phase 0.6 — Execution start & event stream
- Implemented `start_execution()` to trigger transaction execution via `/api/execute` or `/api/jupiter/swap`
- Added run ID tracking for tracing purposes

### Phase 0.7 — Reporting & Supabase persistence
- Implemented `get_run_report()` to retrieve run information via `/api/runs/:id`
- Implemented `get_transaction_status()` to check transaction status via `/api/transactions/:hash`

## Error Handling & Instrumentation

Several key enhancements were made to improve reliability and observability:

1. **Retry Mechanism**: Added exponential backoff retry logic in `_make_request_with_retry()` for failed API calls
2. **Structured Logging**: Enhanced logging with additional context such as endpoint, status code, and payload size
3. **Correlation IDs**: Added run_id propagation via X-Run-Id header for tracing
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Implemented fallbacks for missing API endpoints

## Testing

A comprehensive test script `test_api_integration.py` has been created to validate each phase of the integration. The tests follow the PLAN_TESTSCRIPT guidelines ensuring each slice is proven sound before proceeding to the next.

### Running the Tests

1. From the project root, run:
   ```
   python run_tests.py
   ```

2. To test a specific phase, use the `--phase` flag:
   ```
   python run_tests.py --phase 0.1
   ```

### Test Coverage

The tests verify:
- API connectivity and health check (Phase 0.1)
- Wallet creation and derivation (Phase 0.2)
- Balance polling (Phase 0.3)
- Funding operations (Phase 0.5, disabled by default to prevent actual transfers)

## Next Steps

1. **Deployment Testing**:
   - Deploy a staging bot connected to the Render API
   - Verify end-to-end functionality

2. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Monitor API latency and error rates
   - Implement alerting for SLA breaches

3. **Load Testing**:
   - Validate the system can handle the target volume (500 transfers in 10 minutes)

## Known Limitations

1. The direct Jupiter swap execution is not implemented, as it requires an `/api/execute` endpoint
2. Funding tests are disabled by default to prevent accidental transfers of real tokens
3. Some endpoints might not exist on the API, fallbacks have been implemented where possible
